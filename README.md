# C++ Game and Encryption Script

This C++ script is designed for learning the basics of C++ programming. It includes various simple games and an encryption/decryption tool to practice fundamental programming concepts.

## Features

- **Games**:
  - **Rock-Paper-Scissors**: Play against the computer and see who wins!
  - **Coin Flip**: Guess heads or tails, or let the computer flip the coin for you.
  - **Dice Roll**: Roll a dice and guess the outcome, or let the computer show you the result.

- **Encryption/Decryption**:
  - **Encryptor**: Input a sentence and encrypt it with a simple character shifting method.
  - **Decryptor**: Input an encrypted sentence and a key to decrypt it.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like g++, part of the GNU Compiler Collection).


## Usage

  - Follow the on-screen prompts to choose between encryption/decryption or one of the games.
  - For games, make your selections based on the instructions provided.
  - When using the encryptor or decryptor, enter the text or key as prompted.
